description: Blog kickoff.
summary: I want to explain interesting things and I've decided a blog is the best format for it. Here you'll find deep, technical content, written in Catalan and in English, that I'll also replicate to other platforms.

Sometimes I feel like explaining things, interesting things, but I never find the time or know where to put them so they reach someone.

After reading Hacker News regularly for months, the superiority of blogs for explaining the kind of things I want to explain is clear to me. So I'll set up this blog as a hub and replicate the articles to other more closed outlets.

This is also my effort to ensure that high-quality, deep, and technical content exists in Catalan.

I hope I don't get stuck in the implementation of the blog. We'll see.
